The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

   abstract = {Note-taking is an ever-present learning activity in students’ daily lives, and an increasing number of mobile terminals have been integrated into curriculums. However, the effectiveness of the use of digital note-taking on mobile terminals on students’ learning has not been deeply explored. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how digital note-taking using mobile terminals affects student performance, with particular regard to declarative, procedural and conditional knowledge learning. A quasi-experiment was conducted for three months among 72 first-year high school students from a computer science (CS) course. In the study, students in the experimental group (n = 40) recorded notes digitally, whereas the students in the control group (n = 32) used the conventional approach (i.e., recording handwritten notes). The results indicate that the students who recorded notes digitally scored significantly higher than those who recorded notes conventionally. The students who were designated as “excellent,” and those who were designated as “low-performing,” were most likely to benefit from this new method of note-taking.},

   abstract = {Most educators consider note-taking a critical component of formal classroom learning. Advancements in technology such as tablet computers, mobile applications, and recorded lectures are altering classroom dynamics and affecting the way students compose and review class notes. These tools may improve a student's ability to take notes, but they also may hinder learning. In an era of dynamic technology developments, it is important for educators to routinely examine and evaluate influences on formal and informal learning environments. This paper discusses key background literature on student note-taking, identifies recent trends and potential implications of mobile technologies on classroom note-taking and student learning, and discusses future directions for note-taking in the context of digitally enabled lifelong learning.},

   abstract = {Taking good notes is linked to success in college. However, increased use of computers to take notes necessitates reconsideration of the linkages between note-taking and learning. One difficulty is disentangling the latent student characteristics that may correlate with computer use from the actual effect of computer note-taking on information retention. The authors employ a within-subject, random control experiment to distinguish whether the commonly perceived negative correlation between digital note-taking and performance is due to the note-taking process itself, or is instead due to the characteristics of students who choose to use computers. Their findings suggest that digital note-taking does not have a statistically meaningful impact on student performance; rather, the problem likely lies in the students’ choice to use the computer.},
